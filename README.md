Hi, :D 

I’m @OliCapybara, 
I’m just here to mess around and maybe make some small games :)

Currently, I am working on games built in the HTML5 + Javascript (well- Typescript actually bc at least that's a little better)

I also have a couple of side projects in C++ but idk when I'll have the motivation to finish those ^^'
So for now they are just sitting there in the corner. Collecting dust. (one has gotten moldy...)

I might participate and fail in some game jams too in the future!
